Config driven UI- When we want to render two different UI at some place as per some value and dynamically  add some fields.
Instead of adding all those dynamic fields we should create a object as schema with all fields name as key.


Why we should not use  index as key :
We should use key so that we can avoid rerender of unnecesaary items when we have same items like  list four times.
But we should not use key Beacuse if  any state value is change and if we add a elemenemt in top then it will add that element in top  and the prev items id will also get change so it will re render all items.
Eg:
Before
 <ul>
  <li key=1>Milk</li>
  <li key=2>Eggs</li>
  <li key=3>Bread</li>
  <li key=4>Butter</li>
</ul>
After 
<ul>
  <li key="1">Cream </li>
  <li key="2">Milk</li>
  <li key="3">Eggs</li>
  <li key="4">Bread</li>
  <li key="5">Butter</li>
</ul>
