git init: for doing any git cmd like push pull , we need to initialize it. It make your code compatible with git.

babelrc- configuration file for babel

FunctionalComponent:  A function which returns React element. It is good to start it with capital letter.
In function component it is not mandatory to write return we can skip return and just render React element.

JSX- It is HTML like  syntax used in React. In JSX we can write any js code in curly braces{......}
It can  have only one parent.

React element example:
const  heading= <h1>Hello </h1>
to render react element Eg. root.render(heading)
to render it inside  a component use {heading}

React component example: (different is of function, react component is function but element is object)
const MyComp= ()=>{
    return(<h1> Helooo World</h1>)
}
to render react component. Eg. root.render(<MyComp/>) ---(in angular bracket)
to render it inside a component use like <MyComp/>


Error: Functions are not valid as react child error means we are having a function but rendering it as React element it should render as component means in  a ngular bracket or use parenthesis to use it.

Component Composition: If we are using component inside component is called composing component.

BrowserList: In package.json if we add this with "browserList":["last 2 chrome versions"] --It means  it will definitely  be available on last two chrome version.

Babel: It is transpiler which  convert Jsx code into react element.
