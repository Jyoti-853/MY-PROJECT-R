Redux

We can't create more than one store.

In store we have different slices(like userStore, themestore.. to make all store mangeable and separate)

We can't modify store directly( we will dispatch a action and it will call a function known as reducer
 to make changes in store)

 when we click on Add button it will  dispatch an action  it will call reducer function whicvh will change the slice of store.

 to read the data from redux we need selector.(selecting a portion from store).
 Selector is a hook.(useSelector).,Hook is function end of the day.

 * dispatch an action---->call reducer--->update the state---
  UI <---- selector<---store *

  We use selector to subscribe the store means like to subscribe the themeStore in Store (to subscribe the slice)

  Provider- to connect my react application to redux store we need Provider.

  configureStore  --It is a function to create our own store

  steps for  starting redux
  1. create store by configureStore method.
  2. Provide my store to app by using Provider and pass mystore in store props.
  3. Create a slice by using createSlice function.
  createSlice({
    name:,
    initialState:
    reducers:{
        addItem: (state, action)=>{}
    }
  })
  4. Put that slice in store
  configureStore({
    reducer:{
        cart: cartSlice ---------   cart is name from create SLice method and  cartSLice is my slice name
    }
  })
5. subscribe to the store --using useSelector
