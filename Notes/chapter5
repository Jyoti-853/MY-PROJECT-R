why  state variable is needed in React?
Every componenmt in React maintains state, everytime when we need to create local variable we need state variable ,  that we can put it in component.
For this we use useState hook to create state variable.

React is one way data binding.
useatste state hook returns a array which has variable name and setfunction name.

If we need any variable in sync with UI then we need state variable. -----imp reason for useState
We can use normal variable if we don't want to see the change in UI.

Whenever any state varisable is change it re render that component.

React is fast because of fast Dom manipulation.
